# Physics-Assisted Explainable Anomaly Detection in Power Systems
In our ECAI 2024 paper, we propose an explainable anomaly detection approach in power systems, which we name *Physics Assisted Statistics for Anomaly Localization (PASAL)*.
In this repository, we provide the code (logic) and the full paper (which includes the supplementary materials).
